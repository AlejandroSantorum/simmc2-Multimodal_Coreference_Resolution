# NOTES:
    - These results are using 'under-predicting' strategy.
    - If we always use num_target_objs_head we get 74.5%
    - The vanilla version of this trained model (not using n_target_head) gets 74.3%
    - Learning rates when training:
        coref head: 10 * 0.3 = 3
        num_target_objs_head: 1
