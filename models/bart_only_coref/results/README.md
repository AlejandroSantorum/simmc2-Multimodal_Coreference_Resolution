# Results of BART-based model
This folder contains the predictions and reports of all experiments run with the BART-based model.

#### Folder structure:

- [`devtest`](https://github.com/AlejandroSantorum/simmc2-Multimodal_Coreference_Resolution/tree/main/models/bart_only_coref/results/devtest): folder containing predictions and results on the `devtest` set.
- [`devtest_only_fashion`](https://github.com/AlejandroSantorum/simmc2-Multimodal_Coreference_Resolution/tree/main/models/bart_only_coref/results/devtest_only_fashion): folder containing predictions and results on the `devtest_only_fashion` set. This results correspond to the **out-of-domain experiments** where the model is trained on a subset of furniture and tested on a subset of fashion.
- [`devtest_only_furniture`](https://github.com/AlejandroSantorum/simmc2-Multimodal_Coreference_Resolution/tree/main/models/bart_only_coref/results/devtest_only_furniture): folder containing predictions and results on the `devtest_only_furniture` set. This results correspond to the **out-of-domain experiments** where the model is trained on a subset of fashion and tested on a subset of furniture.
- [`in_domain`](https://github.com/AlejandroSantorum/simmc2-Multimodal_Coreference_Resolution/tree/main/models/bart_only_coref/results/in_domain): folder containing predictions and results on the `in_domain` set. This results correspond to the **cross-domain experiments** where the model is trained on a subset of fashion and tested on a another subset of fashion.
- [`in_domain_held_out`](https://github.com/AlejandroSantorum/simmc2-Multimodal_Coreference_Resolution/tree/main/models/bart_only_coref/results/in_domain_held_out): folder containing predictions and results on the `in_domain_held_out` set. This results correspond to the **cross-domain experiments** where the model is trained on a subset of fashion and tested on a subset of fashion taking place un an unseen shop in the training set (`cloth_store_1498649_woman` shop).
- [`masked_exps`](https://github.com/AlejandroSantorum/simmc2-Multimodal_Coreference_Resolution/tree/main/models/bart_only_coref/results/masked_exps): folder containing predictions and results on the [masked datasets](https://github.com/AlejandroSantorum/simmc2-Multimodal_Coreference_Resolution/tree/main/models/bart_only_coref/data_object_special/masked_datasets). This results correspond to the **masking experiments** where the model is fed with examples that some parts have been masked (global IDs, canonical IDs, dialog history, multimodal context, etc.).
- [`n_target_objs_head`](https://github.com/AlejandroSantorum/simmc2-Multimodal_Coreference_Resolution/tree/main/models/bart_only_coref/results/n_target_objs_head): folder containing predictions and results for the BART-based model with an additional task head. This head is trying to predict the number of referred objects in the dialog, so the model can refine the predicitions set using this information.
- [`out_of_domain`](https://github.com/AlejandroSantorum/simmc2-Multimodal_Coreference_Resolution/tree/main/models/bart_only_coref/results/out_of_domain): folder containing predictions and results on the `out_of_domain` set. This results correspond to the **cross-domain experiments** where the model is trained on a subset of fashion and tested on a subset of furniture.
