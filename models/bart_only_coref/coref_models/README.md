# Pre-trained and fine-tuned models

The pre-trained and fine-tuned models can be directly downloaded using the following links.

All the fine-tuned models for the experiments of this project can be downloaded individually from this folder from Google Drive: [coref_models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13ZNu1qCg8mfvroj1PsjVJIuzElhDoycH?usp=sharing).

The entire collection of models can be directly downloaded from: [coref_models.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11LupifQrhIN1uSwqU946KhEBK9OEpENV/view?usp=sharing).

The downloaded parameters should be stored in [`coref_models`](https://github.com/AlejandroSantorum/simmc2-Multimodal_Coreference_Resolution/tree/main/models/bart_only_coref/coref_models) folder. As said before, this folder with the fine-tuned models can also be directly downloaded from Google Drive: [coref_models.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11LupifQrhIN1uSwqU946KhEBK9OEpENV/view?usp=sharing).
