# Pre-trained models

The pre-trained models can be directly downloaded using the following links.

- BART-based model only using output heads focused on MM Coreference Resolution: [bart_coref](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/129-4HfFSl5Pa3g_FB1eiAbiWAfMrM_yP?usp=sharing).
- BART-based model only using **empty_coref_head** and **coref_head**. The attributes head is *deactivated*: [bart_coref_no_attrs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v37k1_88wA2kPxcdQ2A5VNYCH_nJkHKL?usp=sharing).

This folder with the pre-trained models can also be directly downloaded from Google Drive: [coref_models.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wv4W_kbqlo0Phlg5q9G_qwmYvNulXbad/view?usp=sharing).

Whenever a new BART-based model is fine-tuned, the system parameters are stored in this folder.
