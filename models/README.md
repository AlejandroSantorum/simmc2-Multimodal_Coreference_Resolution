# Models for MM Coreference Resolution.

This folder contains all the investigated systems in this project:

- [`gpt2_baseline`](https://github.com/AlejandroSantorum/simmc2-Multimodal_Coreference_Resolution/tree/main/models/gpt2_baseline): replication of the baseline model introduced in [*"SIMMC2.0: A Task-oriented Dialog Dataset for Immersive Multimodal Conversations"*](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.401.pdf), using the code from the [SIMMC2.0 repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/simmc2).
- [`KAIST_BART_based`](https://github.com/AlejandroSantorum/simmc2-Multimodal_Coreference_Resolution/tree/main/models/KAIST_BART_based): replication of the model described in [*"Tackling Situated Multi-Modal Task-Oriented Dialogs with a Single Transformer Model"*](https://openreview.net/forum?id=NajekV9uBas), using the [open source code](https://github.com/KAIST-AILab/DSTC10-SIMMC) of the original team.
- [`bart_coref`](https://github.com/AlejandroSantorum/simmc2-Multimodal_Coreference_Resolution/tree/main/models/bart_coref): previous system modified by removing other task heads that are *not* related with coreference resolution.
- [`bart_only_coref`](https://github.com/AlejandroSantorum/simmc2-Multimodal_Coreference_Resolution/tree/main/models/bart_only_coref): previous system modified by removing all specific-task heads but the one performing coreference resolution. Auxiliary task heads are also deleted. This is the main directory where the majority of experiments on the [BART-based model](https://openreview.net/forum?id=NajekV9uBas) are available and described.
- [`uniter_based`](https://github.com/AlejandroSantorum/simmc2-Multimodal_Coreference_Resolution/tree/main/models/uniter_based): replication of the model described in [*"UNITER-Based Situated Coreference Resolution with Rich Multimodal Input"*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03521), using the [open source code](https://github.com/i-need-sleep/MMCoref_Cleaned) of the original team. This is also the main directory where the majority of experiments on the [UNITER-based model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03521) are available and described.
- [`combined`](https://github.com/AlejandroSantorum/simmc2-Multimodal_Coreference_Resolution/tree/main/models/combined): simple system that combines the predictions of one of the best BART-based models with one of the best UNITER-based models to obtain a boost in performance due to the ensemble of both solutions.
